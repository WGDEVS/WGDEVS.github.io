I want to study for an optimal 3 hours for a course

Start at the last day
list the courses in reverse cronological deadline order


Ignore all courses that have already had their deadline dates passed [they are pushed around in the list but don't do much]
If the course has the exam on that day ignore it for now <-
Give 3 hours for each unignored course and loop until you run out of time or reach the end of the list,
if you reach the end, then simply pad the time with all the time from a single course in the list and move on
If at any time during the last two steps a course runs out of time, pop it from the list
<- If still empty assign time from course on that day (last first, assign until time runs out from either)

Reorder the list, so that the one cut in half/next is now first, if the last day was the deadline, it gets moved to the top
repeat for this day.
